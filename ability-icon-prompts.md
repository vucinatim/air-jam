Overall Style Notes for the generator (optional preface)
Use this context if needed to establish the look before sending the individual prompts.

"I need to generate three distinct graphic elements for mobile game UI icons. The style is 'Futuristic Minimal Neon Arcade'. They must be glowing geometric light constructs against a dark, subtle digital background. Crucially, these images must NOT have any border, frame, or containing edge generated around them. They should be isolated graphics ready to be placed into a CSS container."

Ability 1: Health Pack (Nano-Repair Cell)
Concept: A stylized cross/plus symbol integrated into a futuristic containment unit. Cyan and lime green for "healing energy".

Revised Prompt:

A professional UI graphic element for a sci-fi health ability. A central, glowing minimalist neon cross symbol is encased within a stylized, translucent hexagonal nanite containment cell. The cross glows with intense cyan light, and the surrounding hexagon features lime green and electric blue neon rim lighting. The style is clean, geometric, and arcade-like, with a sharp digital light bloom effect isolated against a seamless, dark, circuit-board patterned background. There is absolutely no border or frame around the image edge.

Ability 2: Rocket (Plasma Missile)
Concept: An aggressive, sleek projectile with a kinetic trail. Hot orange and deep purple for "weapon energy".

Revised Prompt:

A professional UI graphic element for a sci-fi rocket ability. A sleek, angular, forward-facing missile silhouette rendered in glowing neon lines. The warhead tip glows hot orange, transitioning into a deep violet plasma exhaust trail that streaks horizontally behind it, forming kinetic speed lines. The style is sharp and dynamic, featuring a minimalist geometric design with heavy neon saturation and light flares isolated against a seamless, dark, abstract space grid background. There is absolutely no border or frame around the image edge.

Ability 3: Speed Boost (Overdrive Thruster)
Concept: Abstract symbols conveying upward acceleration. Electric yellow/gold and cobalt blue for "high energy".

Revised Prompt:

A professional UI graphic element for a sci-fi speed boost ability. Three stacked, stylized chevron arrows pointing upward, rendered in intensely glowing electric yellow and cobalt blue neon light. Behind the arrows, radiating light streaks and a stylized afterburner flare effect imply rapid acceleration. The design is highly geometric, kinetic, and minimal, emphasizing motion blur with neon light trails isolated against a seamless, dark, data-stream patterned background. There is absolutely no border or frame around the image edge.
